# CBS Project roadmap

Currently the main target is to become self hosted tool and start to build itself without any internal scripts and autoconf tools. 

For now version 0.0.1 is released. 

For the next version there are plans for improoving support of diffrent types of dependencies (currently quite stable is only system dependencies), build-in pre- and post- build scripts and basic compilation parameters. 

For the 0.0.2 version bigger part of the code should be covered with comments(brief description of every function).
