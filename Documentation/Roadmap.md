# CBS Project roadmap

Currently the main target is to make build system stable and ensure that all functions and commands works as expected.

For now version 0.0.4 is released. 

For the next version (it should be 0.1.0) there should be more bug fixed and tests. Unit tests will be extended and, maybe, integration tests will be provided. There will be no new features in Beta 1. 

In paralel there will be planing for 0.1.1 version with new features.
